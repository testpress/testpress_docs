In the above data `hash` value is used to identify that the data is indeed posted from testpress.

## How To Generate The Hash And Verify The Authenticity Of The Data
HMAC (Hash-based message authentication code) is used to avoid tampering during the request flow.
The hash is calculated using the following algorithm:
* Get the values of 'public_key', 'attempt_id', 'correct_answers_count', 'private_key', 'incorrct_answers_count', 'unanswered_count', 'percentage', 'score', 'user_id'
* Create a string by appending the above percentage encoded values using | pipe character. Maintain the same order while appending
* Calculate the HMAC using HMAC-SHA512 with the private key.
* Private key can be taken from the admin dashboard.
hmac.new(secret, message, hashlib.sha512).hexdigest()
